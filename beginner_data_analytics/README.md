📊 Beginner Data Analytics Project – Sales Data Analysis
========================================================

📌 Project Overview
-------------------

This is a beginner-level Data Analytics project where I performed basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a small sales dataset using **Python and Pandas** in Google Colab.

The goal of this project was to understand how to:

*   Import and use pandas
    
*   Create and manipulate a DataFrame
    
*   Perform revenue calculations
    
*   Use groupby() for analysis
    
*   Generate business insights from data
    

🛠 Tools Used
-------------

*   Python
    
*   Pandas
    
*   Google Colab
    

📂 Dataset Description
----------------------

The dataset contains the following columns:

*   **Product** – Name of the product
    
*   **Category** – Product category
    
*   **Quantity** – Number of items sold
    
*   **Price** – Price per unit
    
*   **Revenue** – (Created column) Quantity × Price
    

🔍 Steps Performed
------------------

1.  Imported pandas library
    
2.  Created a dataset manually
    
3.  Converted data into a Pandas DataFrame
    
4.  Revenue = Quantity × Price
    
5.  Calculated:
    
    *   Total Revenue
        
    *   Top-selling product (by quantity)
        
    *   Product generating highest revenue
        
    *   Category generating highest revenue
        
    *   Category selling most items
        

📈 Key Insights
---------------

*   The product with highest quantity sold was **Mouse**.
    
*   The product generating highest revenue was **Laptop**.
    
*   **Electronics** category generated the highest revenue.
    
*   Revenue depends not only on quantity but also on product price.
    

🧠 What I Learned
-----------------

Through this project, I learned:

*   How to work with DataFrames
    
*   How to perform aggregation using sum()
    
*   How to use groupby() for category-wise analysis
    
*   How to think analytically using real data
    
*   Basic concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    

🚀 Future Improvements
----------------------

*   Load data from CSV file instead of manual input
    
*   Handle missing values
    
*   Add data visualizations (bar charts, line charts)
    
*   Work with larger real-world datasets
